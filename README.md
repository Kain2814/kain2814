## Hey everyone! :D 

I'm currently in school for software engineering
This is supposed to be like a resume website (hopefully)
It is a class project and one I will be devoloping over time as I grow even after school.

Currently I am familiarizing myself with more advanced JS functions and intro to python

I have also been really interested in bot learning and creating my own chatbot.
